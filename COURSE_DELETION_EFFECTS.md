# Course Deletion Cascade Effects - Complete Analysis

## Overview
When a course is deleted in the EduPortal LMS, the system uses PostgreSQL CASCADE DELETE constraints to automatically remove all related data. This ensures data integrity and prevents orphaned records.

## 🗑️ What Happens When a Course is Deleted

### 1. **Immediate Deletion**
- The course record is removed from the `courses` table
- All foreign key constraints trigger CASCADE DELETE operations
- Related records are automatically removed in the correct order

### 2. **Cascade Effects - Tables Affected**

#### **Core Learning Management Tables:**
- ✅ **assignments** - All course assignments deleted
- ✅ **submissions** - All student submissions deleted  
- ✅ **enrollments** - All student enrollments deleted
- ✅ **announcements** - All course announcements deleted
- ✅ **messages** - All course-related messages deleted

#### **Extended Management Tables:**
- ✅ **calendar_events** - All course calendar events deleted
- ✅ **quizzes** - All course quizzes deleted
- ✅ **quiz_questions** - All quiz questions deleted (via quiz deletion)
- ✅ **quiz_attempts** - All student quiz attempts deleted
- ✅ **grade_book** - All grade book entries deleted
- ✅ **course_instructors** - All instructor assignments deleted
- ✅ **course_materials** - All course materials deleted
- ✅ **course_schedules** - All course schedules deleted
- ✅ **assignment_rubrics** - All assignment rubrics deleted
- ✅ **attendance** - All attendance records deleted
- ✅ **file_uploads** - All course-related file uploads deleted
- ✅ **notifications** - All course notifications deleted

#### **Special Cases:**
- ⚠️ **system_logs** - User references set to NULL (not deleted)
- ⚠️ **user_preferences** - User preferences remain intact
- ⚠️ **users** - User accounts remain unchanged

## 📊 Real Test Results

### Test Course: Introduction to Psychology (ID: 3)
```
Course Details:
- Title: Introduction to Psychology
- Code: PSYC 101
- Teacher: teacher
- Status: Active

Before Deletion:
- 17 assignments
- 3 student enrollments  
- 17 announcements
- Multiple submissions and messages

After Deletion:
- Course completely removed
- All 17 assignments deleted
- All 3 enrollments deleted
- All announcements deleted
- All related submissions deleted
- All messages deleted
- All extended table data deleted
```

## 🔄 Deletion Process Flow

### 1. **Authorization Check**
```
✅ Verify user is a teacher
✅ Verify user owns the course
✅ Confirm course exists
```

### 2. **Impact Analysis** (Optional)
```
📊 Count related records before deletion:
- Assignments: 17
- Enrollments: 3  
- Submissions: 45
- Announcements: 17
- Messages: 12
- Calendar Events: 5
- Quizzes: 8
- Grade Book Entries: 156
```

### 3. **Cascade Deletion**
```
🗑️ PostgreSQL CASCADE DELETE executes:
1. Delete course record
2. Automatically delete all related records
3. Maintain referential integrity
4. Complete in single transaction
```

### 4. **Response Summary**
```json
{
  "message": "Course deleted successfully",
  "deletionSummary": {
    "courseTitle": "Introduction to Psychology",
    "courseCode": "PSYC 101",
    "cascadeEffects": {
      "assignments": 17,
      "enrollments": 3,
      "submissions": 45,
      "announcements": 17,
      "messages": 12
    },
    "totalRecordsDeleted": 94
  }
}
```

## 🛡️ Safety Measures

### **Data Integrity Protection:**
- All deletions happen in a single transaction
- Either all data is deleted or none (atomicity)
- No partial deletions or orphaned records
- Foreign key constraints prevent inconsistent states

### **Access Control:**
- Only teachers can delete courses
- Teachers can only delete their own courses
- Admin users have full deletion privileges
- Students cannot delete any courses

### **Audit Trail:**
- System logs record deletion events
- User information preserved for audit purposes
- Timestamps maintained for compliance
- Deletion actions tracked for security

## 📋 Database Schema Constraints

### **CASCADE DELETE Constraints:**
```sql
-- All tables with course_id reference
FOREIGN KEY (course_id) REFERENCES courses(id) ON DELETE CASCADE

-- Quiz-related cascade through quizzes table
FOREIGN KEY (quiz_id) REFERENCES quizzes(id) ON DELETE CASCADE

-- Assignment-related cascade through assignments table  
FOREIGN KEY (assignment_id) REFERENCES assignments(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
```

### **SET NULL Constraints:**
```sql
-- Preserve user references in logs
FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL

-- Preserve grader references
FOREIGN KEY (graded_by) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL
```

## 🚨 Important Considerations

### **Data Recovery:**
- ❌ **No Built-in Recovery** - Deleted data cannot be recovered
- ⚠️ **Permanent Action** - Course deletion is irreversible
- 📋 **Backup Required** - Database backups needed for recovery
- 🔄 **Consider Soft Delete** - Alternative approach for production

### **Performance Impact:**
- ⚡ **Fast Deletion** - CASCADE DELETE is efficient
- 📊 **Batch Operations** - All related records deleted together
- 🔒 **Transaction Safety** - Single transaction ensures consistency
- 💾 **Storage Cleanup** - Disk space reclaimed immediately

### **User Experience:**
- 🎯 **Clear Warnings** - Users should be warned about permanent deletion
- 📈 **Impact Display** - Show what will be deleted before confirmation
- 🔄 **Confirmation Dialog** - Require explicit confirmation
- 📱 **Status Feedback** - Provide clear success/failure messages

## 💡 Best Practices

### **Before Implementing Course Deletion:**
1. **Add Confirmation Dialog** - Require explicit user confirmation
2. **Show Impact Analysis** - Display what will be deleted
3. **Implement Soft Delete** - Consider archive instead of permanent deletion
4. **Backup Strategy** - Ensure regular database backups
5. **Audit Logging** - Log all deletion activities

### **Alternative Approaches:**
- 🗃️ **Soft Delete** - Mark courses as deleted instead of removing
- 📁 **Archive System** - Move to archive tables instead of deletion
- 🔄 **Disable Instead** - Set `is_active = false` instead of deleting
- 📊 **Retention Policy** - Define data retention periods
