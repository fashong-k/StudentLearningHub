```json
{
  "validation": {
    "canUpdate": true,
    "warnings": [
      "Date changes will affect 2 assignments. Assignment due dates may need to be adjusted.",
      "Date changes will affect 3 enrolled students. They should be notified of the schedule change.",
      "Semester change will affect 3 enrolled students. This may impact their academic planning."
    ],
    "errors": [],
    "affectedRecords": {
      "enrollments": 3,
      "assignments": 2,
      "announcements": 2,
      "submissions": 3
    }
  }
}
```

## üé® Frontend Integration
